# Union Shop

Union Shop is a lightweight Flutter e-commerce demo app built for university students.
It provides a simple storefront to browse products, add items to a persistent cart,
and run through basic checkout flows (for demo purposes).

Key features:
- Browse products and collections sourced from local JSON data.
- Hero carousel and responsive product cards for multiple screen sizes.
- Persistent cart saved locally; simple checkout simulation.

This README will be built iteratively — subsequent sections will add install,
usage, tests, project structure, and contact details.
